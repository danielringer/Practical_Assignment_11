# Practical_Assignment_11

When I was younger, I worked for a used car auction. Dealers would view all of the details provided as the used vehicles came across the auction block. With little time available, dealers must make a decision on how much they are willing to spend on the vehicle while also considering how much they can sell it for.\Â¶
Using Scikit-Learn, we will analyze the data provided and determine what features among the vehicle inventory that attracts buyers. Additionally, the model will allow dealers to quickly identify a price point for specific vehicles available at auction to make the best puchasing decisions when building up their inventory.

Find my notebook here: [Ringer_Practical_Assignment_11.1.ipynb](https://github.com/danielringer/Practical_Assignment_11/blob/main/Ringer_Practical_Assignment_11.ipynb).

The data had a vast amount of missing values. While we attempted to fill those values with the highest probable value, there was still some guess work involved to build the data. The largest factors associated with prices include:
- The age of the vehicle
- The drive system
- The engine size (cylinders)
- The total mileage
- I would suggest focusing on these factors when purchasing used car inventory.

# Recommendations
Further analysis is required to better the model to bring the predictions closer to the actual prices.

Better tuned data will better define the model.

Once the model is successfully predicting the prices, dealers, while at auction purchasing inventory, could input features of vehicles to know what they can expect the value to sell.

This model would act in the same way as a dealers Black Book.

### Learning facilitator/Grader: Can you please offer some guidance on how I can fix this failed model? I attempted removing numerous features like fuel and age but no matter what I did, the prediction never came close to actual prices. I would like to revisit this assignment and fix the model so I have a better understanding going forward.

I am not asking for another attempt at my grade. This is only for my personal improvement
